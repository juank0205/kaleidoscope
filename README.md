# Kaleidoscope Compiler Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Kaleidoscope Compiler Project! This repository is more than just a collection of code â€“ it's a gateway to understanding the intricate world of compiler design and implementation. Kaleidoscope is not just a programming language; it's a pedagogical tool designed to illuminate the path for those venturing into the complex yet fascinating realm of compilers.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to provide a hands-on experience in compiler construction, demystifying the process of turning high-level code into executable machine language. Kaleidoscope serves as a simple yet powerful language model, offering a unique blend of educational clarity and practical compiler design techniques.

### Why Kaleidoscope?

- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for students and educators in computer science, especially in courses focusing on compilers, programming languages, or systems programming.
- **Simplicity and Power**: While Kaleidoscope is simple enough to be approachable, it embodies the core principles of language design and compiler construction.
- **Real-World Application**: The project bridges theory and practice, providing insights into how compilers work in the real world.

## Getting Started

Dive into the world of compiler design:
- **Explore the Language**: Understand the syntax and features of Kaleidoscope.
- **Follow the Compilation Steps**: Walk through lexical analysis, parsing, AST generation, and code generation.
- **Experiment and Extend**: Use the provided framework to experiment with language features or add new ones.
